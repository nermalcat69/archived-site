This social experiment led me to understand that Humans are flawed and they are very easy
to fool even if they are experienced beings, people who are funded by one of the biggest
venture capitalists in the world.

Don't ever feel insecure if you're not getting funded maybe it's about your soft skills
and mindset more than just your technical skills.

Just because you're not being validated by one single successful person doesn't mean
you're not valuable. You're supposed to be valuable infront of masses because they
are your target audience not a single person.

Idolizing and seeking attention of one specific person is the worst thing you can do
to be successful as per the societal norms. At the end of the day you're meant to compete
with your previous generation and not with your peers who had a totally different circumstances.

Well enough yapping about the society, let's just dive more into this thing I pulled off.

[Raghav Sharma](https://x.com/Some1UKnow25) did a tweet mentioning that he joined openai and
he has chatgpt in localhost. 

<div class="tweet-container">
  <Tweet id="https://x.com/Some1UKnow25/status/1939425405825695873/" />
  <a href="https://x.com/Some1UKnow25/status/1939425405825695873/" target="_blank" class="text-sm text-neutral-700">open on X</a>
</div> 

And well he got reach on that tweet and well I can get that reach too. Well i would like to call
this systematic tweeting as **bandwagon reach** on twitter *(i just made that word up, because
whenever there's a specific theme trending you can just join the bandwagon and get extra reach)*

Then I was like let's do something similar maybe with [Claude](https://claude.ai), I manually
copied the frontend of claude and then ran it on localhost, 

<div class="tweet-container">
  <Tweet id="https://x.com/ArjunShips/status/1939728482168430596" />
  <a href="https://x.com/ArjunShips/status/1939728482168430596" target="_blank" class="text-sm text-neutral-700">open on X</a>
</div> 

------

Some days back when i was running [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com)'s open source code
locally and it was not using localhost instead it was mapped to `gumroad.dev` so hmmm
my goofy ahh brain thought I can do something with this mechanism.

On a random morning I was like why not build a reverse proxy backend which maps a
website to localhost, Then i went on to build a reverse proxy golang backend and
Next.js Frontend to bait people.

Before we start this i would like to give special thanks to [Raghav Sharma](https://x.com/Some1UKnow25),
[Ayush Singh(shydev)](https://x.com/shydev69) and [Salfiya](https://x.com/traschcannot) for helping
me with reach and emotional support.

At first people believed that this is so real then someone said it's downloaded html or
i'm using wget or using /etc/hosts to map all the websites to localhost.

I had to delete the tweet after 1.3M impressions and 1.8k followers because it got
reported.

<div class="tweet-container">
  <Tweet id="https://x.com/ArjunShips/status/1943049186154545319/" />
  <a href="https://x.com/ArjunShips/status/1943049186154545319/" target="_blank" class="text-sm text-neutral-700">open on X</a>
</div> 


Example of one of the videos used in the tweet *(i made a thread of 20 videos in
that tweet tagging those websites)*.

<div class="w-full flex justify-center">
  <iframe width="360" class="rounded-lg" height="200"

  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"

</div>

<p class="text-sm text-center text-neutral-700">*ps: i use screen studio to record
videos.</p>

## Why did this go viral?

Whenever we write a tweet we are supposed to consider that this tweet is going to be seen by a
lot of people and not everyone has the same knowledge base inside their smoll brain or attention span
to understand the tweet.

After considering all that info we are supposed to simplify it so much that everyone can comprehend it.

But again complex stuff gets attention if your target audience is geeks or wanna be geeks.

**Reasons for Virality**:
- **Simplicity** of the tweet
- **Media Inclusion**(crazy boost when you use image + video)
- **First 1 Hour**(5 Reposts from big accounts and 30 likes are enough to get the ball
rolling if your tweet is goated)
- **Lovable, V0 & Bolt are not enough for them**. *(no one will ever trust a cursor
alternative as it's too good already)*
- People need this product which can **replicate beautiful components**
*(they hate the tag of vibe coded shadcn ui)*.
- It was just very **unique + very unrealistic** *easy to trigger quotes
& replies*.
- **Tagging accounts** help the tweet reach to the followers of the tagged
account *(personal experience)*
- **Big accounts liking your tweet** gets the tweet recommended to their
followers.

Personally, I think there's a huge space in generating animated components
with perfect color theory and [ux laws](https://lawsofux.com) using gsap and
framer motion.





### The Public Composition

class="postImage" />

Public composition is almost similar everywhere and if you can milk
them then you can easily make it.

ps: Haters also include people who maybe need a piece of your virality.

<img src="./nobody-noticed.jpg" alt="Hatred from public" width="50%"
class="pt-10" />

People move on really fast but it takes time, fabricating and changing your public
persona isn't that hard even if you're the worst person on this planet.

## Who Noticed

- CTOs dm'd me to help them to improve their product.
- People offered me money to sell access to the tool.
- Two Founders tried to hire me.
- Designers & Web Agencies.

Considering I want to stay independent, I had to ditch all the offers.

I should mention that there's still room to serve customers with AI wrappers.
AI products sell well, and despite high churn rates, you're veryyy likely to
generate at least thousand dollars in revenue.


ALSO WHY TF IS THERE NO GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE BY AI WRAPPERS EXCEPT CURSOR?

## Technical Implementation

#### API Integration
The frontend makes HTTP requests to `http://localhost:8080/api/create-proxy?url={target}` which returns JSON containing
the assigned port and localhost URL.

The Go server handles these requests by spawning new proxy instances and returning
the connection details for immediate use.

#### Golang Backend
The backend uses `httputil.NewSingleHostReverseProxy(targetURL)` to create dedicated reverse proxies for each target site.
Each proxy runs in its own [goroutine](https://go.dev/tour/concurrency/1) on auto-allocated ports starting from 3001. It
selectively rewrites URLs based on Content-Type headers - only HTML content (`text/html`) undergoes URL transformation while other
content types (CSS, JS, images, JSON) pass through unchanged.

The proxy performs bidirectional header manipulation by setting `r.Host = targetURL.Host` for outbound requests and rewriting
`Location` headers in responses for proper redirect handling. All original headers are preserved by default, including
Content-Type, Cache-Control, and Set-Cookie headers. The response modification pipeline reads HTML content, transforms
external links to localhost addresses, and updates Content-Length accordingly.

CORS headers are automatically enabled to allow frontend communication.

#### Data Flow
User submits URL → API call creates proxy → Go server spawns reverse proxy on available port → Returns localhost URL → User accesses
proxied content through localhost while proxy fetches from original site behind the scenes.

The architecture maintains thread-safety through mutex locks and provides real-time proxy creation with instant feedback.

ps: this won't bypass the auth because the origin is not localhost.

I'll open source the code if you guys are interested, but for that help this tweet reached 200 likes first.


## The End Results

Got shadowbanned after a report after getting 1.8k Followers & 1.3M impressions.

Well I got to know that you can just deactivate your account for 72 hours and then
reactivate it and you're good to go but most likely you'll have to delete your tweet
+ request for a review *you'll most likely get a notification for that*.


Feel free to check my other [Viral Tweets](/posts/viral-tweets) too.

Also you can always reach out to me on [X](https://x.com/ArjunShips) or at [meow@nermalcat69.dev](mailto:meow@nermalcat69.dev).

ps: if i made any mistake you can @ArjunShips me on X.

ps: images with drawings are from pinterest *not sure who's the artist* but you can
always reverse image search using google image search, yandex image or even tineye
(tineye is mid tho).

Also just a random tip whenever you're trying to find info don't forget to check exif
data but nowadays a lot of platforms just delete that data.
