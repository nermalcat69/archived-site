Whenever a person goes into some mental distress, it's mainly because of
missing out on some important things in life.

As per evolutionary biology, Humans are meant to fulfill some criterias
to be a part of this society because to be social and validated
to some extent for their efforts and contributions is needed to keep them
sane and increase their chances of survival.

Also equated to them feeling good about themselves + self love became a thing
for them.

Humans with good standing and pedestal were considered worthy in the eyes of
others and got all the attention and love from the society.

They got all the things a person desires in life, requited love, validation,
respect, money, power, etc.

Any Sane Human will share interests with others and they're very likely to
be mentally stable but if they don't, They're very likely to go through a bit
rough time but as interestingly as it sounds, Internet made it pretty easy to
find similar interests like sharing the love for cute anime girls for that stuff
we have reddit and 4chan.

Point being validation is the biggest need in life, *just my personal opinion*

But we can always refer everything to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs for that.

![Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](./maslows.webp)

People be like "humans used to panic when they had to run from a tiger,
now they panic when someone leaves them on seen. we failed as species"

I would like to mention that this is not called failing, we as humans
are very much similar to our ancestors but our means and criterias just
pivoted a lil bit.

We've inherited almost everything from having the love for some specific
food to having a type of person we're attracted to.

Btw, Just a random theory that if you're attracted to a person, It's also
because that person is a replacement of your parent. For example, if you're
a guy attracted to a girl, It's because that girl is a replacement of your
mother and vice versa.

I think this theory was mentioned by Sigmund Freud afaik.

But according to societal standards, nobody thinks about having sex with their
opposite sex parent, *referring to the Oedipus and Electra complexes*

I wrote a quote some months back,
> "Humans are clueless and they think outrageous stuff and conclude it for no fricking reason,
> Everything is Symbolic" - [my archived ranting insta during my worst mental health
state](https://www.instagram.com/arjunexpressed).

Well let's just talk about how does anyone get to the top of the pedestal?

By going delusional, if they don't have resources, they'll just manipulate their
brain into taking crazy risks.

Mental state plays the biggest part in societal success because our brains are
wired in a way to make decisions as per survival instincts.

Insensitive people are very likely to take very rational decisions and emotionally
unstable people tend to ruin everything and that's the only bar which stops them to
reach the top.

A person who comes from a good economic background has a very high chance to generate
exponential amount of wealth because how for them they are pretty confident and
being confident about something.

Delusion kept people above the average pedestal because they always maintained
themselves optimistic and others were stuck in flight or fight mode.

Being delusional is a privilege considering your background and life choices
some don't like taking the risk and some don't like taking the responsibility.

### Impressing People

<img src="./bojack-1.webp" alt="Knowledge" class="" width="50%" />

I'm still very much into impressing people but I think you can never impress everybody,
you can't look cool or valuable to everyone because their experiences and situations made
them to judge and opt in for survival mode for certain type of person.

The way there's a stereotype about how a Haryanvi men fears Punjabi women and how Himachali
Women love Punjabi men.

And changing that societal stereotype takes time, if your identity is hated by someone it's
very rare for you to get validated by them.

Some VCs heavily go after white founders, some go after Indian founders, some go after stanford
dropouts and some go after people with neurodivergent backgrounds.

Because that's their preference and they are not wrong, they are just doing what they think is right.

Just a person trying to feel safe because their survival instincts prefer that.

I've always seeked validation from people I've looked upto and not being upto the mark in their eyes
made me question my whole skill and capability.

### Failing at my first mvp (17yo)

I was starting a startup called Codestake with two friends I met on discord,
[Viraj Shah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viraj-shah15/) and [Priti Roy](https://x.com/DevPriti1).

The idea of codestake was basically mix of Hackathons, Algora & Superteam Earn(was suggested by amy), A place
where a developer can make money either by serving bounties or by competing in hackathons.

But as usual it was my first time working on an idea with people and them having expectations from me.

I got overwhelmed and ended up ruining everything we had after a month because i was not able to fix
an error and I was very insecure of asking for help but well after some time I compensated them with
some money because I felt that they deserved it atleast for even giving a bit of their time.

Going all in is nice but not staying chill pushes you into the burn out zone, I remember priti told me how
playing games helped her mental health and burn outs *basically i ended up playing minecraft because macos :/*

Then later had to move on from Codestake.

*A month later*

Posted some stuff on a subreddit and met [LinearArray](https://www.reddit.com/user/LinearArray/)
and then later moderators of very pretty big indian subreddits. Also met [Namish](https://namishh.me)
and no he was not a moderator.

<img src="./knowledge.webp" alt="Knowledge" class="postImage" width="70%" />
<span class="caption">Never applied to jobs as i suffer from severe imposter syndrome *i still do as of july 22,2025*</span>

Well either way as i had some design & creative skills i ended up improving a big discord server
and then later became an admin in just 11 days(basically i had the access to ban 4k members at once).

Then later had a pretty big drama on the subreddit and got hate comments by atleast 1k people but well
we move on again.

All these reddit incidents happened in Jan - March 2024 Time Frame

I don't really like being stuck at one place so i just ditch and go for the bigger quest
*love the word quest*. Moving on from things and pivoting is pretty doable for me as i was
never really biased to just my thoughts, i don't mind change.

What were the main reasons of my mental health & burn out
- Autonomy
- Financial Outcome
- Validation
- Pointless Work in my Eyes
- No Public Audience to Cater




### Self Sabotage






### Imposter Syndrome




### Financial Issues




Being responsible is pretty much the hardest part.

Some People fold and some just keep on going.

Your observation touches on fundamental aspects of human psychology and evolutionary development. Let me elaborate on these interconnected concepts:

## **The Social Brain Hypothesis**

Humans evolved in small, cooperative groups where social bonds were literally matters of survival. Our brains developed sophisticated mechanisms for:
- **Reading social cues** and understanding group dynamics
- **Forming attachments** that provided safety and resources
- **Seeking belonging** as a core survival strategy

When these social needs aren't met, our brain interprets it as a threat to survival, triggering stress responses that can manifest as anxiety, depression, or other mental health challenges.

## **The Validation-Purpose Connection**

**Evolutionary Perspective:**
- Humans who contributed meaningfully to their group were more likely to survive and reproduce
- Recognition and validation signaled that we were valuable members of the community
- This created a deep psychological need to feel useful and appreciated

**Modern Implications:**
- We still crave that sense of being valued and having a role
- Without validation, we may experience feelings of worthlessness or inadequacy
- Purpose gives us direction and helps us feel our lives matter

## **What We're "Missing Out On"**

**Core Human Needs Often Unmet:**
1. **Meaningful Relationships** - Deep connections where we feel truly known
2. **Purpose and Direction** - Goals that align with our values and give life meaning
3. **Community Belonging** - Feeling part of something larger than ourselves
4. **Personal Growth** - Sense of progress and development
5. **Autonomy** - Feeling we have some control over our lives

## **The Modern Disconnect**

**Why These Needs Go Unmet Today:**
- **Social fragmentation** - We're more isolated despite being "connected"
- **Unclear life paths** - Traditional structures (religion, community, clear career paths) have weakened
- **Comparison culture** - Social media creates unrealistic standards
- **Fast-paced living** - Little time for deep reflection or relationship building

## **The Biological Reality**

When these fundamental needs aren't met, our bodies respond with:
- **Stress hormones** (cortisol, adrenaline) that were meant for short-term threats
- **Inflammation** that can affect both physical and mental health
- **Neurotransmitter imbalances** affecting mood, motivation, and cognition

## **Building a Framework for Wellbeing**

Understanding this can help us:
- **Identify specific gaps** in our social or purpose-driven needs
- **Prioritize relationships** and community involvement
- **Seek meaningful work** or volunteer opportunities
- **Create structure** for personal growth and goal achievement

Your insight highlights that mental distress often isn't just about individual pathology - it's about fundamental human needs going unmet in our modern world. Recognizing this can help us address root causes rather than just symptoms.
