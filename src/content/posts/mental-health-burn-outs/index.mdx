Whenever a person goes into some mental distress, it's mainly because of
missing out on some important things in life.

As per evolutionary biology, Humans are meant to fulfill some criterias
to be a part of this society because to be social and validated
to some extent for their efforts and contributions is needed to keep them
sane and increase their chances of survival.

Also equated to them feeling good about themselves + self love became a thing
for them.

Humans with good standing and pedestal were considered worthy in the eyes of
others and got all the attention and love from the society.

They got all the things a person desires in life, requited love, validation,
respect, money, power, etc.

common interests like having the love for cute anime girls or tall hot boys

but now even for absurd stuff we have reddit or 4chan

People be like "humans used to panic when they had to run from a tiger,
now they panic when someone leaves them on seen. we failed as a specie"

I would like to mention that this is not called failing, we as humans
are very much similar to our ancestors but our means and criterias just
pivoted a lil bit


Retaliation and survival mechanism of not going some route

Delusion kept people above the average pedestal because there's always a
way to keep our brain optimistic and actually make it because the flight
or fight mode

Being delusional is a privilege considering your background and life choices
some don't like taking the risk and some don't like taking the responsibility.

But again you can never impress everybody, you can't look cool or valuable to everyone
because their experiences and situations made them to judge and opt in for survival mode
for certain type of person. The way a Haryanvi guy fears Punjabi women and how Himachali
Women love Punjabi men.

Some VCs heavily go after white founders, some go after Indian founders, some go after stanford
dropouts and some go after people with neurodivergent backgrounds.

Because that's their mindset and they are not wrong, they are just doing what they think is right

Being responsible is pretty much the hardest part.

Some People fold and some just keep on going.

Your observation touches on fundamental aspects of human psychology and evolutionary development. Let me elaborate on these interconnected concepts:

## **The Social Brain Hypothesis**

Humans evolved in small, cooperative groups where social bonds were literally matters of survival. Our brains developed sophisticated mechanisms for:
- **Reading social cues** and understanding group dynamics
- **Forming attachments** that provided safety and resources
- **Seeking belonging** as a core survival strategy

When these social needs aren't met, our brain interprets it as a threat to survival, triggering stress responses that can manifest as anxiety, depression, or other mental health challenges.

## **The Validation-Purpose Connection**

**Evolutionary Perspective:**
- Humans who contributed meaningfully to their group were more likely to survive and reproduce
- Recognition and validation signaled that we were valuable members of the community
- This created a deep psychological need to feel useful and appreciated

**Modern Implications:**
- We still crave that sense of being valued and having a role
- Without validation, we may experience feelings of worthlessness or inadequacy
- Purpose gives us direction and helps us feel our lives matter

## **What We're "Missing Out On"**

**Core Human Needs Often Unmet:**
1. **Meaningful Relationships** - Deep connections where we feel truly known
2. **Purpose and Direction** - Goals that align with our values and give life meaning
3. **Community Belonging** - Feeling part of something larger than ourselves
4. **Personal Growth** - Sense of progress and development
5. **Autonomy** - Feeling we have some control over our lives

## **The Modern Disconnect**

**Why These Needs Go Unmet Today:**
- **Social fragmentation** - We're more isolated despite being "connected"
- **Unclear life paths** - Traditional structures (religion, community, clear career paths) have weakened
- **Comparison culture** - Social media creates unrealistic standards
- **Fast-paced living** - Little time for deep reflection or relationship building

## **The Biological Reality**

When these fundamental needs aren't met, our bodies respond with:
- **Stress hormones** (cortisol, adrenaline) that were meant for short-term threats
- **Inflammation** that can affect both physical and mental health
- **Neurotransmitter imbalances** affecting mood, motivation, and cognition

## **Building a Framework for Wellbeing**

Understanding this can help us:
- **Identify specific gaps** in our social or purpose-driven needs
- **Prioritize relationships** and community involvement
- **Seek meaningful work** or volunteer opportunities
- **Create structure** for personal growth and goal achievement

Your insight highlights that mental distress often isn't just about individual pathology - it's about fundamental human needs going unmet in our modern world. Recognizing this can help us address root causes rather than just symptoms.
