A friend, a software engineer at an Indian software security company developing codebase related security products, referred me for a dev rel position because that friend admired my work at Zerops. I declined the offer as I'm really not into security and the pay was minimum wage (20,000 INR / $230 approx.).

I feel sad for employees of that company as all of them are cracked asf but they get paid like 30k INR - 50K INR D:
