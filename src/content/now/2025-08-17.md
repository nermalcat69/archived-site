I got reached out by a ceo again on 15th August(he reached out to me on 2nd july as well). He clearly mentions that he really wants me to work at his company as a founding engineer with 2% equity.

&nbsp;

I tell him, Let's get on a call on Monday(18th of July). He replies with nothing and leaves me on seen.

I reply next day with
"sure bro, thanks for leaving me on seen

&nbsp;

ain’t joining thanks for your efforts, feel free to block me 😄🙏" Sent on 16th August

Reason behind this message was him not sending "sure" and still tweeting on his twitter(shitposting about some stuff) the day before.

&nbsp;

Then he replies with
"Hey hey I have tons of DMs and work"

&nbsp;

"And alright I guess I don’t see a fit. Good luck I wish you all the best" - 16th of August

&nbsp;

Then I wait for him to unfollow, He unfollows me on 19th August and then I Unfollow him as well :>

Back to working on <a href="https://coldran.com/" target="_blank">Coldran</a>.
