As of today I've been rejected by 3 Investors / Grants.

&nbsp;

- Solo.Club
&nbsp;
- Founders Inc Investor (he said get a job to fix your problems)
&nbsp; 
- <a href="https://merge.club/program/mergegrant" target="_blank">Merge Grant</a>(Applied for $906)

&nbsp; 

This creates an impression over my brain that F*ck Investors & GO BOOTSTRAPPED / DEBTSTRAPPED.

&nbsp; 

I've also applied to YC as a solo founder even though they prefer a co-founder as well.
Their Decision will come by 5th of Sept iirc.
