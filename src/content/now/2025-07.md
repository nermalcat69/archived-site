Building Ruklist, which i'm planning to launch within some days and <a href="https://sqlbase.io" target="_blank">SQLBase</a>, hopefully release by the end of this month. After that, I'll focus on improving these projects and start working on a customer interaction related platform.

I've been experiencing poor customer support service over the past week. It's not entirely their fault but it's more about the inefficient user flow and how they organize and manage feedback.

Also, five days back I scraped a sf based startup's Discord server's channel using a selfbot without hitting the rate limits then fed the data to chatgpt and used its deep research mode to identify the top 50 problems.
