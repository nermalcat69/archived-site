An Indian origin CEO reached out to me, impressed by my tweet *i think*, and wanted to hire me as a founding engineer(full time) for his b2b startup, which had recently received a non-dilutive grant from [WTFund](https://www.allthingswtf.com/wtfund) by [Nikhil Kamath](http://x.com/nikhilkamathcio).

I wouldn't really blame him if I were in his position, I would reach out as well because having creative techie unhinged person is a perfect choice for a high frequency startup. But well the pay was legit lower than my pay from Zerops.

Another reason to complete my own products fast.
