I baited the entire tech Twitter community with a tweet about an AI website cloner that was actually just a GoLang reverse proxy backend mapping to localhost ports and reached 1.3M Views. I received a lot of hate, but many CEOs, CTOs, and investors initially believed it was real. However, I had to be honest with them *i'm a baiter not a scammer*.

Had to <a href="https://x.com/ArjunShips/status/1943049186154545319" target="_blank">delete that tweet</a> because I was reported and temporarily shadowbanned. The conclusion? Don't bait people LEL

But atleast I got 1.9k+ Followers in 2 days
