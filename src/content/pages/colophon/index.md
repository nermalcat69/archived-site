## About this site

This website is a forked version of [eva.town](https://eva.town) - [source code](https://github.com/evadecker/eva.town).

## Technology

This site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build). Astro handles the content-heavy views (written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com)), but for more interactive components I use [React](https://react.dev) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

Code is edited using [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) on a [MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/).

End-to-end tests are written using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev), and I use [Polypane](https://polypane.app) to preview devices, test accessibility, and toggle user preferences like `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Domain registration, hosting, and deployment are via [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). Email forwarding is through [ImprovMX](https://improvmx.com). I send occasional [newsletters](https://buttondown.email/notesfromeva) using [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email).

I shared more about the hardware I use on [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/interviews/eva.decker/).

## Typography

Text is set in [HEX Franklin Variable](https://hex.xyz/HEX_Franklin/) with code in [`MonoLisa`](https://www.monolisa.dev/). Typography is scaled using a lot of math and a [fluid type scale](https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-with-fluid-type-scales) by [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/type/calculator/), meaning that font sizes will interpolate between mobile and desktop to optimize for the current browser width.

Type inspiration can be found anywhere, from comic art and video games to [bodega window displays](https://www.are.na/eva-decker/nyc-bodega-art), but I often return to a handful of resources:

- [_The Elements of Typographic Style_](https://bookshop.org/a/97627/9780881792126) by Robert Bringhurst
- [Butterick’s Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com)
- Bethany Heck’s [Font Review Journal](https://fontreviewjournal.com)
- [Fonts In Use](https://fontsinuse.com)

## Styling

I use [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) to apply palettes consistently, ensure accessibility, and seamlessly switch between light and dark mode. Icons are from [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com). Styles are written using plain 'ol CSS. Pixel portraits of me were created by [@NullTheFool](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@NullTheFool) on the [Pixel Art Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pixelart). Pixelated header images are created using the Atkinson dithering algorithm via [Dithermark](https://app.dithermark.com).



## Energy

I minimize energy usage on this site by avoiding unnecessary scripts (such as trackers, analytics, or resource-intensive animations) and compressing images to webp and video to webm(feel free to suggest me a better way).

> The internet consumes a lot of electricity. 416.2TWh per year to be precise. To give you some perspective, that's more than the entire United Kingdom.
> <cite>[Website Carbon Calculator](https://www.websitecarbon.com)</cite>

As of October 18, 2023, [carbon results for eva.town](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/eva-town/) indicate that the home page is cleaner than 95% of web pages tested, producing 0.05g of CO<sub>2</sub> per page view.


## Privacy

I collect basic, fully-anonymized page view analytics using [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/ref/VMZJZD). I don't want your data! If you don't believe me, take a look at the [public analytics for eva.town](https://app.usefathom.com/share/wkftecuz/eva.town). On the flip side, if you're doing something cool and want to connect with me feel free to [dm me](https://x.com/arjunships)
