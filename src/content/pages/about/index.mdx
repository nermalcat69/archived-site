Oh hey, you want to know about me? Hmmm let me think *sorry i tend to forget my achievements {">.<"}*

<br />


Started my internet journey in 2016 (born in 2006), Starting with Luckypatcher to spending hours on Unity to later freelancing in Wordpress and Ghost.org Community. Spending time on Reddit and since then I've been chronically online and building web applications.

Worked at a Czech company [Zerops](https://zerops.io) for an year as an intern who did almost everything from *Programming → Design → Dev Rel → Customer Support*, and after contemplating for a while, I decided to be an Indie Hacker.


I'm the type of guy who's always online with a response rate of 2-3s **ONLY IF I'M ONLINE**

Born in Haryana, Spent majority of my life in Delhi, India.

I began coding in the late 2000s, typing into a textarea of vBulletin for a Nintendo fan forum. Without syntax highlighting, `border-radius`, or `flexbox`, I'd spend hours exporting assets from Photoshop and laying out content in CSS.

Type a few characters, and suddenly every `button` changes colors on hover. (From blue to... a slightly different blue!) I thought this was the coolest thing in the world.

I still think coding is cool.

Most of my job titles have included the word "designer", but code is my medium and the browser is my favorite design tool. I believe that designing for the web means working _in the medium_ of the web—namely, HTML and CSS. Interactive mediums deserve interactive iteration.

I love working digitally, but when I need to think about gnarly problems, I take my sketchbook and my pen, I find a quiet place to sit, and I write.

I currently work at [Scribe](https://scribehow.com) as a Senior Design Engineer. Previously, I spent time building things at [Cityblock](https://cityblock.com), [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com), and [Swiftype](https://swiftype.com). You can [download my resume here](/downloads/eva-decker-resume.pdf).

In my free time I play piano and listen to city pop and noodle with synths. I like [reading](https://hardcover.app/@evadecker) about urbanism, transit, and queer history, and I tend to a small but growing apartment balcony garden.

Always open to chats and coffee in NYC. [Say hello!](mailto:hey@evadecker.com)
