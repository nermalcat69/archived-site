Started my internet journey in 2016 (born in 2006), Starting with Luckypatcher to spending hours on Unity
to later freelancing in Wordpress and Ghost.org Community. Spending time on Reddit and since then I've been
chronically online and building web applications.

Worked at a Czech company [Zerops](https://zerops.io) for an year as an intern who did almost everything from
_Programming → Design → Dev Rel → Customer Support_, and after contemplating for a while, I decided to be an
Indie Hacker.

I'm the type of guy who's always online with a response rate of 2-3s **ONLY IF I'M ONLINE**

🌾 Born in Haryana, Spent majority of my life in Delhi, India.

I was a chaotic kid in my middle school, Used to yap to everyone specifically the guy who had a problem of answering
questions with too much context even though that part was not a part of our grade. 7th grade was the best year of my life.
In Covid, I didn't get enough validation from my teachers so ended up spending a lot more time on the internet.

Then after some money came in, Academics felt pointless and I pivoted. I was a kid with the worst handwriting, worst at drawings,
worst at singing, worst at dancing, worst at musical instruments but i was good at computers and sports(ego reasons maybe).

Well there was a girl who used to listen to my yaps in 7th grade but that's a different story for another day T-T.

and many more.

Having no strings attached and i believe in bootstrapping

I love spending time just converting files from one format to another and my favorite site from inspiration are [SaasLandingPage](http://saaslandingpage.com),
[DeadSimpleSites](https://deadsimplesites.com), [Vercel Templates](https://vercel.com/templates), [Astro Templates](https://astro.build/themes/1/), and
[Dribbble](https://dribbble.com).

Also very random but Exploitation pays more *coughs how llms are trained* *how apollo scrapes* but then it's normalized.

Personally I'd put myself as a person who can do everything to create an impact, My source of happiness is helping non technical people interact with internet better.

### My Personality Traits

I love it simple and I love to be very straightforward - everything can be simplified.

> "It's so simple to be happy but so difficult to be simple" - Rabindranath Tagore

Materialism is a mere part of my life, Which helps me to connect with people who value it over thoughts and I'm lucky to have these resources
as it opens so many doors.

I like optimizating and oversimplifying things to people to the point where anyone can understand it, Sometimes people find me weird as if i'm high on drugs.

The most difficult part for me is selling myself than my own product, specifically when it comes to interviews where i'm
supposed to explain my self *there's no self*. This is one of the reasons why I started this website so that I can express
myself as Selling products is comparatively easier than explaining the self.

- **Work Life**: Work more is basically doing enough to sustain my validation and financial jar, This whole internet industry is my passion
after normal human behavior(going out, working out, eating, sleeping, etc.) and I'm not a person who's afraid of work but it should have a purpose.
I'm not biased towards my ideas but I do tend to show multiple iterations of my ideas / prototypes because I really want to try my best.

> As Fyodor says "Deprived of meaningful work, men and women lose their reason for existence; they go stark, raving mad"

If you're feeling burnt out You're more likely deficient in:
1. Nutrients in your Blood
2. Sleep
3. Exercise
4. Social Interaction
5. Small Wins
6. Meaningful Work (Too much repetition is also bad for your brain)
7. Autonomy
8. Caffeine Abuse
9. Lack of journaling

If you're missing out on anything above, regardless of your gender you're very likely to fall into depression.

&nbsp;

- **Product Perspective**: Design is the most important part of a product, Simple & Straightforward User flow.

We should really consider the target potential customers as demographics matter even colorblind people. Watch [Phoebe Yu](https://www.youtube.com/@phoebeyutbt)
videos as she explains how design differs around the world.

Also I have a really big complaint about customer support by companies, How they don't hire people around the world for 24/7 customer support.
Connection Matters a Lot.

- **Life Perspective**: I'm in love with myself more than anyone and everyone should feel the same about themselves. I can behave my own way without considering
my public perception with a straightforward and sometimes being called a insensitive person. Being Delusional is a good thing.

I love to go all in if the work seems worthy and I'm too lazy to buy my own clothes, online shopping hurts my brain. Or maybe it's not my current priority.

That's one of the same reasons why I don't plan going to college.

- **Daily Barriers**: I have ADHD, Dysgraphia and Color Blindness(Deutranopia).

- **Hobbies**: Yapping in a VC, Walking topless in Sun, Running, Cooking, and Helping people for free.

- **Interests**: Softwares, Designing, Biology, Finance, Psychology, Evolution, Human Behavior, and Philosophy.

I love using spiral notebooks. whenever I have a thought, I jot it down. Also pretty random but I have sucha bad
handwriting which is unreadable somehow, I was slapped 4 times in school just for having bad handwriting.

Writing your thoughts help you to think better and I'm a person who's always thinking about something.

Currently building some Micro Products and bootstrapping a Startup. Plus, My current goal is to travel around the world + have an office in San Francisco with Thinkers & Designers.
